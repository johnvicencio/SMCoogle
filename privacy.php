	<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

	<p>
	CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and 
	online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California 
	to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates 
	websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a 
	conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and 
	those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. 
	See more <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">here</a>.

	<h2>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h2>
	<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
	<p>
	Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, 
	or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
	</p>

	<p>Our Privacy Policy page includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on here at the bottom or the footer.

	<p><strong>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes</strong>: On our Privacy Policy Page.</p>

	<p><strong>Users are able to change their personal information</strong>: By emailing us and By chatting with us or sending us a ticket.</p>

	<p>
	We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a 
	Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
	</p>

	<h2>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h2>

	<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>

	<h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

	<p>
	When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the 
	Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. 
	The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, 
	enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online 
	services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
	</p>

	<p>
	We do not specifically market to children under 13.
	</p>
	<p>We will respond to your inquiry no later than 14 business days</p>
